# Anthem Cycles

Anthem Cycles is intended for live execution by a performer.  Sequential code blocks are executed one at a time (top down) in order but the timing between blocks is indeterminate and left to the taste and discretion of the performer.  Most sounds are synthetic and written in SuperCollider with the exception of several percussion sounds processed in Logic and the use of Valhalla's wonderful Supermassive to color several synths.
